## Handoff Notes for Next Session

### What Exists:
- Complete project structure with 10 directories
- CLAUDE.md with full standards including sensitivity guidance and transliteration rules
- README.md with gap analysis and cross-references
- Bibliography.md with ~15 real academic sources organized by category
- Key-Figures-Index.md with 50+ figures organized by period
- Major-Conflicts-Index.md with 25+ battles/campaigns
- Story-Potential.md with 10 detailed dramatic period analyses
- This SESSION-STATE.md with full phase task lists

### What to Do Next (Phase 1):
1. Begin with TL-00-Master-Timeline.md -- the temporal backbone
2. This is a large timeline (610-1258 CE = 648 years); consider splitting across sessions
3. After the master timeline, proceed to Rashidun period profiles (Muhammad, Abu Bakr, Umar, Ali) as they are foundational to everything else

### Key Decisions Made:
- Following academic research project model (Persian_Empire, Crusades patterns)
- Standalone database; fiction projects are consumers
- "For Fiction Writing" sections included but generic
- Sensitivity guidelines for Islamic religious content
- Sunni/Shia differences noted but neither privileged
- Arabic transliteration uses common anglicized forms in running text
- Confidence levels: [Established], [Probable], [Debated], [Speculative], [Traditional]
- CE dating primary; Hijri dates noted in parentheses where relevant

### Potential Complications:
- **Muhammad profile** will require particular care re: religious sensitivity and source methodology
- **Karbala** entry will need explicit Sunni/Shia historiographical comparison
- **Assassins/Nizari** entry should counter orientalist stereotypes while preserving drama
- **House of Wisdom** -- recent scholarship (Gutas) has revised popular understanding; note scholarly debate
- **Connecting to Crusades project** -- ensure consistency of shared figures (Saladin, Baybars, etc.)
- **Connecting to Persian_Empire project** -- seamless transition at the Arab conquest (636-651 CE)

## Research Notes

### Sources Being Used
- Kennedy, Hugh. *The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates*
- Kennedy, Hugh. *The Great Arab Conquests*
- Hodgson, Marshall. *The Venture of Islam* (3 vols)
- Hourani, Albert. *A History of the Arab Peoples*
- Gutas, Dimitri. *Greek Thought, Arabic Culture*
- al-Khalili, Jim. *The House of Wisdom*
- See [[00-Reference/Bibliography]] for full list

### Historiographical Notes
- Early Islamic history relies heavily on sources compiled 150-250 years after events
- al-Tabari is the foundational chronicle but was writing in the early 10th century about 7th-century events
- Revisionist scholars (Patricia Crone, Michael Cook, Fred Donner) have questioned traditional chronologies
- This project follows mainstream academic consensus while noting revisionist challenges
- Coins and inscriptions provide the most secure early dating
