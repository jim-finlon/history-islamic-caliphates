## Notes on Sources

### Source Limitations for Early Islam
The earliest period of Islamic history (610-680 CE) presents particular challenges:
- The Quran is the only contemporary text, and it is not a historical narrative
- The earliest biography of Muhammad (Ibn Ishaq) was written c. 760 CE, over a century after events
- al-Tabari compiled his chronicle in the early 10th century, nearly 300 years after the Prophet's death
- Hadith collections were compiled in the 9th century
- Non-Arabic sources (Greek, Syriac, Armenian) provide some external corroboration but are fragmentary
- Archaeological evidence is growing but still limited
- Coins and inscriptions provide the most reliable early chronological data

### Orientalism Awareness
Older Western scholarship on Islam was often shaped by colonial attitudes and Christian theological assumptions. Be aware of:
- Bernard Lewis's work: widely cited but increasingly criticized for political bias in later career
- Edward Said's *Orientalism* (1978): foundational critique of Western scholarship on the Middle East
- Preference for recent scholarship that engages with Arabic-language academic traditions
- Avoid reproducing "Clash of Civilizations" framing
