# CLAUDE.md - Project Instructions

## Project Identity

**Project Name:** Islamic Caliphates & Golden Age Academic Research Database
**Type:** Standalone Academic Research Project
**Purpose:** Comprehensive historical research on Islamic civilization from the Prophet Muhammad through the Mongol sack of Baghdad (~610-1258 CE)

---

## Critical Instruction

**This is a STANDALONE academic research project.**

- This database is the **source of truth** for historical information about Islamic civilization during the Caliphal period
- Fiction projects are **consumers** of this research
- This project should **NOT reference specific fiction works, characters, or storylines**
- Maintain academic objectivity in all entries
- Include "For Fiction Writing" sections with **generic** guidance for any writer

---

## Sensitivity Note: Islamic Religious History

This project treats Islamic religious history with **scholarly respect**:

- **Theological matters** are presented as beliefs held by the Muslim community, not as truth claims or as fictions. Use formulations such as "Muslim tradition holds that..." or "According to hadith sources..." rather than either affirming or denying religious claims.
- **The Prophet Muhammad** is treated as a historical figure. His religious significance is acknowledged as the belief of over a billion people. Use respectful academic language (e.g., "Muhammad" or "the Prophet Muhammad" -- the honorific "peace be upon him" may be noted as standard Muslim practice but is not required in academic prose).
- **Sunni/Shia historiographical differences** must be noted wherever they affect the historical record. The succession crisis after Muhammad's death, the events at Karbala, and the legitimacy of various caliphs are viewed very differently by these traditions. Present both perspectives without privileging either.
- **Sectarian terminology:** Use neutral academic language. "Sunni tradition holds..." / "Shia sources maintain..." Avoid language that implicitly validates one tradition over another.
- **Quranic and hadith material** is cited as source material, not as historical proof. Note the difference between isnad-verified traditions and those with weaker chains of transmission, as Muslim scholars themselves categorize them.

## Content Standards

### Academic Quality
- All entries should meet academic research standards
- Cite primary and secondary sources
- Include confidence assessments for claims
- Note scholarly debates and uncertainties
- Distinguish between historical fact, tradition, and legend
- Be transparent about the nature of sources (see Source Types below)

### Arabic Transliteration Standards

**Running text:** Use standard anglicized forms for well-known terms:
- Quran (not Qur'an), hadith, sharia, caliph, imam, mosque, minaret
- Muhammad, Ali, Umar, Uthman, Abu Bakr
- Baghdad, Damascus, Cordoba, Mecca, Medina

**Formal/technical usage:** Note the formal academic transliteration in parentheses on first occurrence:
- Example: "Quran (al-Qur'an)" / "Harun al-Rashid (Harun ar-Rashid)"
- Use diacritics in bibliography entries and when precision matters

**Names:** Use the most common English academic form:
- Avicenna with "(Ibn Sina / Ibn Sina)" noted on first use
- Averroes with "(Ibn Rushd)" noted
- Saladin with "(Salah al-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub)" noted
- al-Khwarizmi, al-Tabari, al-Biruni (retain the "al-" article)

### "For Fiction Writing" Sections
These sections ARE appropriate as they serve any fiction writer:
- Sensory details (sight, sound, smell, taste, texture)
- Character notes (personality, voice, demeanor, reported habits)
- Scene-setting information (architecture, climate, daily rhythms)
- Dialogue opportunities (recorded sayings, speech patterns, rhetoric)
- Period-appropriate cultural details (dress, food, music, etiquette)
- These should be **generic** guidance, not tied to specific fictional works

### Cross-Referencing
- Use Obsidian wiki-links: `[[filename]]`
- Maintain consistent linking between entries
- Index files should provide navigation
- Note connections to related projects (Persian_Empire, Crusades, Byzantium)

## Source Types

### Primary Sources (Arabic)
- **Quran** — foundational religious text; use for cultural/legal context, not as historical chronicle
- **Hadith collections** — Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, and others; note classification (sahih, hasan, da'if) and that compilation occurred 150-250 years after events described
- **Early chronicles** — al-Tabari (*Ta'rikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk*), al-Baladhuri (*Futuh al-Buldan*), Ibn al-Athir
- **Biographical dictionaries** — Ibn Sa'd, Ibn Khallikan
- **Geographic works** — al-Muqaddasi, al-Idrisi, Yaqut
- **Scientific treatises** — al-Khwarizmi, Ibn Sina, al-Biruni, Ibn al-Haytham
- **Travel writing** — Ibn Battuta, Ibn Jubayr
- **Literary works** — *One Thousand and One Nights*, Abu Nuwas, al-Mutanabbi
- **Philosophy** — al-Kindi, al-Farabi, Ibn Rushd, al-Ghazali

### Primary Sources (Non-Arabic)
- **Persian sources** — Ferdowsi's *Shahnameh* (pre-Islamic memory), Nizam al-Mulk's *Siyasatnama*
- **Byzantine sources** — Theophanes, John of Damascus, Anna Comnena
- **Latin/Crusader sources** — William of Tyre, Fulcher of Chartres
- **Syriac sources** — Michael the Syrian, Bar Hebraeus
- **Chinese sources** — Tang dynasty records of Arab contacts

### Secondary Sources
- Modern academic monographs and articles
- Note the historiographical tradition: much early Islamic history was reconstructed from later sources, and revisionist scholars (Crone, Cook, Donner) have challenged traditional chronologies

### Source Reliability Notes
- **Contemporary evidence** is sparse for the earliest period (610-660 CE); most written sources date from 150+ years later
- **Archaeological evidence** is growing but still limited for early Islam
- **Numismatic evidence** (coins) provides some of the most reliable early dating
- **Epigraphic evidence** (inscriptions, including the Dome of the Rock) offers fixed chronological points
- Note when accounts may reflect later political or sectarian agendas projected backward

## Confidence Levels

- **[Established]** — Multiple independent sources; scholarly consensus; archaeological or epigraphic support
- **[Probable]** — Strong evidence from reliable sources; accepted by most scholars
- **[Debated]** — Active scholarly disagreement; multiple credible interpretations exist
- **[Speculative]** — Limited evidence; plausible reconstruction but not proven
- **[Traditional]** — Derived from later Muslim historical tradition without contemporary corroboration; may be reliable but cannot be independently verified

### Usage
Every significant historical claim should carry a confidence tag. Example:
> "The Battle of Yarmouk (636 CE) resulted in a decisive Muslim victory over Byzantine forces [Established], though the exact size of the armies remains [Debated]."
